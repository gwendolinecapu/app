RevenueCat builds and adapts to the ever-changing needs of in-app purchase infrastructure, freeing app businesses to invest their time and resources in growing their product.\n\nInstall this extension to use Firebase services as your RevenueCat backend for in-app purchases on Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Amazon Appstore.\n\nThe extension makes in-app purchases and subscriptions, controls access to premium content, and syncs customer purchase information to Firestore using [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/).\n\nThis extension can:\n\n- Store purchase lifecycle events (e.g., trial starts, purchases, subscription renewals, billing issues) in Firestore and react to them.\n- Store and update information about customers and their purchases in Firestore.\n- Update information about customers' entitlements as Firebase Authentication [Custom Claims](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims).\n\nRevenueCat supports both native iOS and Android apps as well as hybrid cross-platform apps in [React Native](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/reactnative), [Flutter](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/flutter), [Unity](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/unity), [Cordova](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/cordova), and [Ionic](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/ionic).\n\nYou need to [create a RevenueCat account](https://app.revenuecat.com/signup) or already have one set up to use this extension.\n\n#### Events\n\nThis extension emits events, which allows you to listen to and run custom logic at different trigger points during the functioning of the extension. For example you can listen to events when a new subscription has been purchased via the `initial_purchase` event, or whenever a subscription or non-renewing purchase has been cancelled through the `cancellation` event.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\n##### Firebase\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store In-App Purchases & Subscriptions details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- (optional) [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users to enable Custom Claims management.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n##### RevenueCat\n\n- Create a [RevenueCat Project](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/projects) if you haven't already.\n- [Set up a Firebase integration](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/firebase-integration) in [RevenueCat](https://app.revenuecat.com/): Go to your project settings, and under \"Integrations\", click \"Add\", then \"Firebase\".\n- From the newly created integration, copy your _shared secret_. You will need this to set up the extension.\n\n##### Mobile App\n\nFollow the steps in the [RevenueCat documentation](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started) to add the RevenueCat SDK to your mobile app. In addition, follow the instructions to [set up the Firebase Integration](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/firebase-integration) inside the app by:\n\n- Listening to Firebase Authentication events and [setting the RevenueCat app user ID to the Firebase UID](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/firebase-integration#2-set-firebase-user-identity-in-revenuecat).\n- Setting the [reserved RevenueCat subscriber attribute](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/firebase-integration#set-firebaseappinstanceid-as-a-subscriber-attribute) `$firebaseAppInstanceId` to the Firebase App Instance ID if you want to send events to Google Analytics for Firebase.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Cloud Secret Manager\n- If you enable events [Eventarc fees apply](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/pricing).\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- RevenueCat ([RevenueCat pricing information](https://www.revenuecat.com/pricing)).\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n","postinstallContent":"#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\n[Set up your security roles](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/firebase-integration#set-your-cloud-firestore-security-rules) so that only authenticated users can access customer information, and that each user can only access their own information. \n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:REVENUECAT_CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n    }\n\n    match /${param:REVENUECAT_EVENTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.app_user_id\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Firebase Integration in the RevenueCat dashboard\n\nLog in to your [RevenueCat Account](https://app.revenuecat.com), select your project in the navigation, then go to integrations -> Firebase.

For example, to check whether the current user has access to an entitlement called `premium`, you could use the following Firebase code:\n\n```javascript\ngetAuth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult()\n  .then((idTokenResult) => {\n     // Confirm the user has a premium entitlement.\n     if (!!idTokenResult.claims.activeEntitlements.includes(\"premium\")) {\n       // Show premium UI.\n       showPremiumUI();\n     } else {\n       // Show regular user UI.\n       showFreeUI();\n     }\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    console.log(error);\n  });\n```\n\n#### List a user's active subscriptions\n\nTo list a user's active subscriptions, you could use the following Firebase code:\n\n```javascript\ngetDoc(doc(db, \"${param:REVENUECAT_CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\", getAuth().currentUser.uid))\n  .then((snapshot) => {\n    if (snapshot.exists()) {\n      snapshot.subscriptions\n        .filter(subscription => new Date(subscription.expires_date) >= new Date())\n        .forEach(subscription => console.log(JSON.stringify(subscription)));\n    }\n  });\n```\n\n#### React to subscription lifecycle events\n\nSubscription lifecycle events get stored as events in the Firestore collection `${param:REVENUECAT_EVENTS_COLLECTION}`. By listening to changes in this collection, for example, through [Cloud Firestore triggered Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/firestore-events), you can trigger any custom behavior that you want. An example could be sending push notifications to customers with billing issues to prompt them to update their credit cards. To do that, you would:\n\n- Store a push notification token for each of your app users, e.g., using [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)\n- Create a new Cloud Function triggered whenever a new document is created in the `${param:REVENUECAT_EVENTS_COLLECTION}` collection\n- In the Cloud Function, determine if the `type` field of the new document is `\"BILLING_ISSUE\"`\n- If so, look up the app user ID from the `app_user_id` field of the new document\n- Look up the push token for that app user ID and send a push notification\n","readmeContent":"# firestore-revenuecat-purchases\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/firebase-integration)\n\n[Install this extension](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/revenuecat-firestore-revenuecat-purchases)\n\nThis extension uses Firebase services as your RevenueCat backend for in-app purchases on Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Amazon Appstore to control access to premium content and sync customer purchase information to Firestore.
